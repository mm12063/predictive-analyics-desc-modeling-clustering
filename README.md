Please see the results.txt file for the best values for k (many achieved 100%), along with their respective confusion matrices and accuracy. The terminal will also output the closest neighbours for all k<=24, along with the accuracy and confusion matrices.

I have implemented an argument ('fuzzy') which you can pass to the code to enable Fuzzy KNN:

To run the code, please navigate to the hw3_src directory and run:

javac -cp ":lib/*" hw3.java
java -cp ":lib/*" hw3

To use Fuzzy KNN, run:

java -cp ":lib/*" hw3 fuzzy
